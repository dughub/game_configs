# Game Configs Project
This project is to store and version control configuration files for games and
related soft/hardware.

## Project Structure

This directory contains scripts that manage configuration files e.g., back up
and restore

This directory contains configuration files used by scripts

These directories contain config files - e.g., .ini | .xml | .cfg
games
hardware
software

## Project Conventions
Primary language will be python for cross platform support, I may also write
some scripts in PowerShell as most gaming is Windows based.

- Naming conventions will follow snake_case
